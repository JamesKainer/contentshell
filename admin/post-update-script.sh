#!/bin/bash

# This script is always run after doing a contentshell update,
# which means you must consider the following:
#
#   1. The script should be re-runnable without causing trouble
#   2. The script should work on any version of RACHEL
#   3. The script should complete quickly and exit cleanly
#
# This takes some doing, but it's important
